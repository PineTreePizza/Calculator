# Calculator

This is a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator and returns the result as output.

# Compiling

1. Using git clone the repository to a folder of your liking
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PineTreePizza/Calculator
```
2. Open a Terminal/Command Line window in the folder and run the following
```
$ cd build
$ cmake --build .
```

This should fully compile it and leave you with an executable file which you should run in your Terminal/Command Line.
